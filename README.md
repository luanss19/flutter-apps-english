<h1 align="center">Flutter-Apps (English)</h1>

<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
   
<p align="center">
   This repository contains links and references to all my projects developed in flutter, with previews of the applications followed by a brief explanation about each one. Because it's a great language to work with and with a lot of room for growth, Dart with the Flutter framework is the area that I'm specializing more lately.<br>
   Some of this apps were made with the couse "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-flutter-app-android-ios/">Creating Android and iOS Apps with Flutter - Create 16 Apps</a>", from the instructor <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/danielciolfi">Daniel Ciolfi</a>.<br>

  As we are currently in a pandemic and the restaurants, markets and stores in general are setting a limit to the number of customers that can be inside, this Flutter application can be used to count how many people are currently in your store and keep track of the number.
